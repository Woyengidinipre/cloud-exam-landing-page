    <p class="text-lg mb-6">
      The Ijaw people, also known as Izon, are one of the oldest and most culturally rich ethnic groups in Nigeria. They primarily inhabit the Niger Delta region, particularly in Bayelsa, Rivers, and Delta States. With a population estimated at over 14 million, they are one of the largest ethnic minorities in Nigeria.
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg mb-6">
      The Ijaw trace their ancestry to the ancient pre-historic communities of West Africa. They have traditionally lived in riverine and coastal environments, which influenced their livelihoods in fishing, boat-making, and trade. Archaeological and oral evidence suggests that the Ijaw people have lived in the Niger Delta for thousands of years, long before the emergence of major kingdoms and colonial powers in the region.
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg mb-6">
      The Ijaw played a significant role in trade with the Portuguese and other Europeans from the 15th century onward. Their strategic position in the delta made them middlemen in commerce involving palm oil, ivory, and slaves. Despite pressures from colonialism and oil exploration, the Ijaw have retained a strong sense of identity and cultural pride.
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg mb-6">
      The Ijaw language, with many dialects such as Kalabari, Nembe, and Izon, is part of the Niger-Congo language family. The Ijaw also have rich traditions in music, dance, and storytelling. Their religious beliefs traditionally centered around water spirits, ancestors, and a creator deity, although many today practice Christianity alongside traditional beliefs.
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg mb-6">
      In modern times, the Ijaw have been at the forefront of environmental and resource control activism, especially concerning oil exploitation in the Niger Delta. Their leaders and youth movements have advocated for justice, environmental sustainability, and economic empowerment of indigenous communities.
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg">
      The Ijaw story is one of resilience, dignity, and cultural endurance. Preserving their history means preserving the legacy of a people who have contributed immensely to the Nigerian nation and African heritage at large.
